# Melanoma Detection with CNN 
> in this project we are detecting melanoma which is a form of skin cancer. to do this we have leveraged CNN layers for image detection using deep nets.

## General Information
- We have a dataset in an unstructed format in form of images.
- We have an image dataset of 9 skin diseases, and our target is to classify all of these successfully.
- This solution can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- We had a class imbalance problem in the dataset, solving which we got a good result.
- We also need to augment the image data, to have different views of the same image.
- dropping some of the connections in a dense layer can help us tackle overfitting.
